# Plant_diagnostics# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Assistant Chatbot

A web application using **Flask**, **Deep Learning**, and an **AI Chatbot** to:
- ðŸ“· Predict plant diseases from uploaded images.
- ðŸ’¬ Answer user questions based on trained intents.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Detect plant diseases from leaf images using a deep learning model (MobileNetV2).
- Chatbot provides answers and plant care advice using custom intents.
- User-friendly web interface.
- `/predict` and `/chat` API endpoints for easy integration with other apps or frontends.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning library for training the image classification model.
- **MobileNetV2**: Pre-trained model for efficient image classification.
- **NLTK**: For natural language preprocessing (tokenizing, lemmatization).
- **Custom Chatbot Model**: Built from intents.json and trained with user-defined conversation flows.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: For building the frontend interface.
